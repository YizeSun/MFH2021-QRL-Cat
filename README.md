# MFH2021-QRL-Cat
This is project named "**training a cat to catch a mouse**" for **Qiskit Fall Fest MUNICH 2021**.
## IDEA PITCH
To solve a grid world environment task using reinforcement learning by variational quantum circuit.
## IDEA DESCRIPTION
What is your idea or solution about?

Deep Q-learning is prevalent for reinforcement learning tasks. How about a deep Q-learning by using the variational quantum circuit. The idea of this project is to create a quantum circuit with variational gates(e.g. Phasegate with parameter) and CX-Gates(for entanglement) and to train the parameters of variational gates for the convergent expectation of Q-value. This idea is not about speedup but about quantum variational algorithms.

**Goal:**

Training a cat (single agent) to catch a mouse in a grid environment(e.g. 2*2, 4*4)
